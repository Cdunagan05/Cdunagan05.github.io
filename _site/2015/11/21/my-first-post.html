<h1>My First Post</h1>
<p>August 14, 2016</p>
<p>I just made this blog and I'm playing around with all the css and html properties,
trying to have fun, and see what crazy things I can come up with.  Hopefully, eventually, I can
improve me css and html skills and make this blog look legit.  I think I will continue working on this for
a while, and see what I can come up with over the next few weeks.  As of right now, it looks terrible. </p>


<p>Should I change this to a md file?  I'll ask around and think about it. </p>
